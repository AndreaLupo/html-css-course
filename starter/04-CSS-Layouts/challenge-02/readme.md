# List of this to be done

Use flexbox to:

1. put the label of FREE SHIPPING on the right of price
2. Use a container with 3 children: image, (money, description, colors), details
3. Add 40px of space between children
4. Refactor the color list
5. Do not set the width of the column of product info and product details. Flexbox must calculate it on its own
